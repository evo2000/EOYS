The building control methods this project focuses on are increased outdoor air ventilation, air filtration and relative humidity control. Reference materials for the Cooper Union facilities team to use in identifying and implementing these changes via adjustments to the 41 Cooper Square HVAC system will be produced. Experimental methods and computational fluid dynamics will be employed to illustrate how significant these adjustments are in improving indoor air quality.",img:["https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1fp1QTHCC9pEfYuAFOaM2mSPIJ3bbV8hR"],website:"https://sway.office.com/Dii6uiENUUupMCyX?ref=Link"},{title:"Lightweight Mars Ascent Vehicle Design",authors:"Andrew Huh, Harris Paspuleti, Hannah Quirk, Alex Seligson",authors_detail:"Andrew Huh ME'21, Harris Paspuleti ME'21, Hannah Quirk ME'21, Alex Seligson ME'21",advisors:"Faculty Advisor: Professor Sven Haverkamp ",tags:["Design","Senior Project"],desc:"The Cooper Union Mars Ascent Vehicle is a cost efficient and light weight solution to safely transport astronauts from the surface of Mars to a low mars orbit where they meet up with their return vehicle.",abstract:"NASA’s goal is to have humans walk on Mars by 2035. A Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) is needed to safely transport astronauts from the surface of Mars to a low mars orbit where they meet up with their return vehicle. Previous MAV designs are too heavy and costly to be feasible. The Cooper Union Mars Ascent Vehicle is a cost efficient and light weight solution designed to meet NASA requirements. Weight savings were achieved by reducing the crew size from four astronauts to two. This MAV utilizes a unique hybrid in-situ propulsion system that greatly reduces mass by eliminating the need for complex cryogenic cooling systems by using paraffin fuel and producing oxidizer on the Martian surface. The final design is a two-stage vehicle with a 3588 kg dry mass. The proposed MAV will travel directly to a higher altitude rendezvous orbit, therefore limiting the risk involved in multiple docking events and eliminating the need for an expensive taxi vehicle.",img:["https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1M6xxihtzcd8Pz2FUb6vbaaPOdNLn0KeF"],website:"https://cooperunionrascal.github.io/"},{title:"Visibly Stressed: Digital Image Correlation as an Educational Tool for Material Deformation Study",authors:"Rose Gebhardt, Chaerin Jun",authors_detail:"Rose Gebhardt ME'21, Chaerin Jun ME'21",advisors:"Faculty Advisor: Professor David Wootton; Lab Technician: Doug Thornhill",tags:["Tech","Senior Project"],desc:"Digital image correlation (DIC) is a useful strain/stress measurement tool, but it can be inaccessible for numerous reasons.

Our project aims to tackle these issues by making source code more accessible and create a simple hardware setup for beginner users. Our system uses a phone camera to feed data to an open-source DIC software. Our goal is to determine factors that reduce accessibility and address them. We tested lower-cost hardware to determine if it could perform as well as the high-speed high-quality cameras typically used for DIC, and we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the software more friendly for those new to programming.
